5.1 Core Container Improvements

    Annotations such as @Bean get detected and processed on Java 8 default methods as well, allowing for composing a configuration class from interfaces with default @Bean methods.
    Configuration classes may declare @Import with regular component classes now, allowing for a mix of imported configuration classes and component classes.
    Configuration classes may declare an @Order value, getting processed in a corresponding order (e.g. for overriding beans by name) even when detected through classpath scanning.
    @Resource injection points support an @Lazy declaration, analogous to @Autowired, receiving a lazy-initializing proxy for the requested target bean.

    The application event infrastructure now offers an annotation-based model as well as the ability to publish any arbitrary event.
        Any public method in a managed bean can be annotated with @EventListener to consume events.
        @TransactionalEventListener provides transaction-bound event support. 

    Spring Framework 4.2 introduces first-class support for declaring and looking up aliases for annotation attributes. The new @AliasFor annotation can be used to declare a pair of aliased attributes within a single annotation or to declare an alias from one attribute in a custom composed annotation to an attribute in a meta-annotation.
        The following annotations have been retrofitted with @AliasFor support in order to provide meaningful aliases for their value attributes: @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, @ComponentScan, @ComponentScan.Filter, @ImportResource, @Scope, @ManagedResource, @Header, @Payload, @SendToUser, @ActiveProfiles, @ContextConfiguration, @Sql, @TestExecutionListeners, @TestPropertySource, @Transactional, @ControllerAdvice, @CookieValue, @CrossOrigin, @MatrixVariable, @RequestHeader, @RequestMapping, @RequestParam, @RequestPart, @ResponseStatus, @SessionAttributes, @ActionMapping, @RenderMapping, @EventListener, @TransactionalEventListener.

        For example, @ContextConfiguration from the spring-test module is now declared as follows:

        public @interface ContextConfiguration {

            @AliasFor("locations")
            String[] value() default {};

            @AliasFor("value")
            String[] locations() default {};

            // ...
        }

        Similarly, composed annotations that override attributes from meta-annotations can now use @AliasFor for fine-grained control over exactly which attributes are overridden within an annotation hierarchy. In fact, it is now possible to declare an alias for the value attribute of a meta-annotation.

        For example, one can now develop a composed annotation with a custom attribute override as follows.

        @ContextConfiguration
        public @interface MyTestConfig {

            @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "value")
            String[] xmlFiles();

            // ...
        }

        See Spring Annotation Programming Model. 
    Numerous improvements to Springâ€™s search algorithms used for finding meta-annotations. For example, locally declared composed annotations are now favored over inherited annotations.
    Composed annotations that override attributes from meta-annotations can now be discovered on interfaces and on abstract, bridge, & interface methods as well as on classes, standard methods, constructors, and fields.
    Maps representing annotation attributes (and AnnotationAttributes instances) can be synthesized (i.e., converted) into an annotation.
    The features of field-based data binding (DirectFieldAccessor) have been aligned with the current property-based data binding (BeanWrapper). In particular, field-based binding now supports navigation for Collections, Arrays, and Maps.
    DefaultConversionService now provides out-of-the-box converters for Stream, Charset, Currency, and TimeZone. Such converters can be added individually to any arbitrary ConversionService as well.
    DefaultFormattingConversionService comes with out-of-the-box support for the value types in JSR-354 Money & Currency (if the 'javax.money' API is present on the classpath): namely, MonetaryAmount and CurrencyUnit. This includes support for applying @NumberFormat.
    @NumberFormat can now be used as a meta-annotation.
    JavaMailSenderImpl has a new testConnection() method for checking connectivity to the server.
    ScheduledTaskRegistrar exposes scheduled tasks.
    Apache commons-pool2 is now supported for a pooling AOP CommonsPool2TargetSource.
    Introduced StandardScriptFactory as a JSR-223 based mechanism for scripted beans, exposed through the lang:std element in XML. Supports e.g. JavaScript and JRuby. (Note: JRubyScriptFactory and lang:jruby are deprecated now, in favor of using JSR-223.)
