6.1 Core Container Improvements

    Core container exceptions provide richer metadata to evaluate programmatically.
    Java 8 default methods get detected as bean property getters/setters.
    Lazy candidate beans are not being created in case of injecting a primary bean.
    It is no longer necessary to specify the @Autowired annotation if the target bean only defines one constructor.
    @Configuration classes support constructor injection.
    Any SpEL expression used to specify the condition of an @EventListener can now refer to beans (e.g. @beanName.method()).
    Composed annotations can now override array attributes in meta-annotations with a single element of the component type of the array. For example, the String[] path attribute of @RequestMapping can be overridden with String path in a composed annotation.
    @PersistenceContext/@PersistenceUnit selects a primary EntityManagerFactory bean if declared as such.
    @Scheduled and @Schedules may now be used as meta-annotations to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.
    @Scheduled is properly supported on beans of any scope.
