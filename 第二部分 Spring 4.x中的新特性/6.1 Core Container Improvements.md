6.1 Core Container Improvements 核心容器的改进

- Core container exceptions provide richer metadata to evaluate programmatically.

核心容器的异常提供更丰富的元数据，为程序提供参考。

- Java 8 default methods get detected as bean property getters/setters.

Java 8 默认的方法

- Lazy candidate beans are not being created in case of injecting a primary bean.
- It is no longer necessary to specify the @Autowired annotation if the target bean only defines one constructor.
- @Configuration classes support constructor injection.
- Any SpEL expression used to specify the condition of an @EventListener can now refer to beans (e.g. @beanName.method()).
- Composed annotations can now override array attributes in meta-annotations with a single element of the component type of the array. For example, the String[] path attribute of @RequestMapping can be overridden with String path in a composed annotation.
- @PersistenceContext/@PersistenceUnit selects a primary EntityManagerFactory bean if declared as such.
- @Scheduled and @Schedules may now be used as meta-annotations to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.
- @Scheduled is properly supported on beans of any scope.
