4.4 WebSocket Messaging Improvements

    SockJS (Java) client-side support. See SockJsClient and classes in same package.
    New application context events SessionSubscribeEvent and SessionUnsubscribeEvent published when STOMP clients subscribe and unsubscribe.
    New "websocket" scope. See Section 26.4.15, “WebSocket Scope”.
    @SendToUser can target only a single session and does not require an authenticated user.
    @MessageMapping methods can use dot "." instead of slash "/" as path separator. See SPR-11660.
    STOMP/WebSocket monitoring info collected and logged. See Section 26.4.17, “Runtime Monitoring”.
    Significantly optimized and improved logging that should remain very readable and compact even at DEBUG level.
    Optimized message creation including support for temporary message mutability and avoiding automatic message id and timestamp creation. See Javadoc of MessageHeaderAccessor.
    Close STOMP/WebSocket connections that have no activity within 60 seconds after the WebSocket session is established. See SPR-11884.
