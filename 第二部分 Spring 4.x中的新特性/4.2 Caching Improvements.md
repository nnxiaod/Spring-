4.2 Caching Improvements

Spring 4.1 supports JCache (JSR-107) annotations using Springâ€™s existing cache configuration and infrastructure abstraction; no changes are required to use the standard annotations.

Spring 4.1 also improves its own caching abstraction significantly:

    Caches can be resolved at runtime using a CacheResolver. As a result the value argument defining the cache name(s) to use is no longer mandatory.
    More operation-level customizations: cache resolver, cache manager, key generator
    A new @CacheConfig class-level annotation allows common settings to be shared at the class level without enabling any cache operation.
    Better exception handling of cached methods using CacheErrorHandler 

Spring 4.1 also has a breaking change in the Cache interface as a new putIfAbsent method has been added.
