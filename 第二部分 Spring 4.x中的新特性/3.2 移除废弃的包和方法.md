3.2 Removed Deprecated Packages and Methods  移除废弃的包和方法

All deprecated packages, and many deprecated classes and methods have been removed with version 4.0. If you are upgrading from a previous release of Spring, you should ensure that you have fixed any deprecated calls that you were making to outdated APIs.

4.0版本中，许多废弃的包、类和方法被移除了。如果你从之前的Spring版本升级过来，你得保证已经修复了所有废弃调用不再使用过期的API。

Note that optional third-party dependencies have been raised to a 2010/2011 minimum (i.e. Spring 4 generally only supports versions released in late 2010 or later now): notably, Hibernate 3.6+, EhCache 2.1+, Quartz 1.8+, Groovy 1.8+, and Joda-Time 2.0+. As an exception to the rule, Spring 4 requires the recent Hibernate Validator 4.3+, and support for Jackson has been focused on 2.0+ now (with Jackson 1.8/1.9 support retained for the time being where Spring 3.2 had it; now just in deprecated form).

注意，可选的第三方依赖已经升级到2010/2011最低版（比如，Spring 4 一般只支持2010年以后发布的版本），比如，Hibernate 3.6+，EhCache 2.1+，Quartz 1.8+，Groovy 1.8+，Joda-Time 2.0+。有一个例外，Spring 4 需要最近的Hibernate Validator 4.3+，Jackson的支持也锁定到2.0+版本（Spring 3.2还支持Jackson 1.8/1.9，现在已经在废弃表单中了）。
