3.7 General Web Improvements

Deployment to Servlet 2.5 servers remains an option, but Spring Framework 4.0 is now focused primarily on Servlet 3.0+ environments. If you are using the Spring MVC Test Framework you will need to ensure that a Servlet 3.0 compatible JAR is in your test classpath.

In addition to the WebSocket support mentioned later, the following general improvements have been made to Springâ€™s Web modules:

    You can use the new @RestController annotation with Spring MVC applications, removing the need to add @ResponseBody to each of your @RequestMapping methods.
    The AsyncRestTemplate class has been added, allowing non-blocking asynchronous support when developing REST clients.
    Spring now offers comprehensive timezone support when developing Spring MVC applications.
