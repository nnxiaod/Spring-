3.6 Core Container Improvements

There have been several general improvements to the core container:

    Spring now treats generic types as a form of qualifier when injecting Beans. For example, if you are using a Spring Data Repository you can now easily inject a specific implementation: @Autowired Repository<Customer> customerRepository.
    If you use Springâ€™s meta-annotation support, you can now develop custom annotations that expose specific attributes from the source annotation.
    Beans can now be ordered when they are autowired into lists and arrays. Both the @Order annotation and Ordered interface are supported.
    The @Lazy annotation can now be used on injection points, as well as on @Bean definitions.
    The @Description annotation has been introduced for developers using Java-based configuration.
    A generalized model for conditionally filtering beans has been added via the @Conditional annotation. This is similar to @Profile support but allows for user-defined strategies to be developed programmatically.
    CGLIB-based proxy classes no longer require a default constructor. Support is provided via the objenesis library which is repackaged inline and distributed as part of the Spring Framework. With this strategy, no constructor at all is being invoked for proxy instances anymore.
    There is managed time zone support across the framework now, e.g. on LocaleContext.
