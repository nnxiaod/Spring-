5.3 JMS Improvements

    The autoStartup attribute can be controlled via JmsListenerContainerFactory.
    The type of the reply Destination can now be configured per listener container.
    The value of the @SendTo annotation can now use a SpEL expression.
    The response destination can be computed at runtime using JmsResponse
    @JmsListener is now a repeatable annotation to declare several JMS containers on the same method (use the newly introduced @JmsListeners if youâ€™re not using Java8 yet).
