5.4 Web Improvements

    HTTP Streaming and Server-Sent Events support, see the section called “HTTP Streaming”.
    Built-in support for CORS including global (MVC Java config and XML namespace) and local (e.g. @CrossOrigin) configuration. See Chapter 27, CORS Support for details.

    HTTP caching updates:
        new CacheControl builder; plugged into ResponseEntity, WebContentGenerator, ResourceHttpRequestHandler.
        improved ETag/Last-Modified support in WebRequest. 
    Custom mapping annotations, using @RequestMapping as a meta-annotation.
    Public methods in AbstractHandlerMethodMapping to register and unregister request mappings at runtime.
    Protected createDispatcherServlet method in AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer to further customize the DispatcherServlet instance to use.
    HandlerMethod as a method argument on @ExceptionHandler methods, especially handy in @ControllerAdvice components.
    java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture as an @Controller method return value type.
    Byte-range request support in HttpHeaders and for serving static resources.
    @ResponseStatus detected on nested exceptions.

    UriTemplateHandler extension point in the RestTemplate.
        DefaultUriTemplateHandler exposes baseUrl property and path segment encoding options.
        the extension point can also be used to plug in any URI template library. 
    OkHTTP integration with the RestTemplate.
    Custom baseUrl alternative for methods in MvcUriComponentsBuilder.
    Serialization/deserialization exception messages are now logged at WARN level.
    Default JSON prefix has been changed from "{} && " to the safer ")]}', " one.
    New RequestBodyAdvice extension point and built-in implementation to support Jackson’s @JsonView on @RequestBody method arguments.
    When using GSON or Jackson 2.6+, the handler method return type is used to improve serialization of parameterized types like List<Foo>.
    Introduced ScriptTemplateView as a JSR-223 based mechanism for scripted web views, with a focus on JavaScript view templating on Nashorn (JDK 8).
