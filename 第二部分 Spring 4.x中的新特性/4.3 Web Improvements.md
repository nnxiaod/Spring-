4.3 Web Improvements

    The existing support for resource handling based on the ResourceHttpRequestHandler has been expanded with new abstractions ResourceResolver, ResourceTransformer, and ResourceUrlProvider. A number of built-in implementations provide support for versioned resource URLs (for effective HTTP caching), locating gzipped resources, generating an HTML 5 AppCache manifests, and more. See Section 22.16.9, “Serving of Resources”.
    JDK 1.8’s java.util.Optional is now supported for @RequestParam, @RequestHeader, and @MatrixVariable controller method arguments.
    ListenableFuture is supported as a return value alternative to DeferredResult where an underlying service (or perhaps a call to AsyncRestTemplate) already returns ListenableFuture.
    @ModelAttribute methods are now invoked in an order that respects inter-dependencies. See SPR-6299.
    Jackson’s @JsonView is supported directly on @ResponseBody and ResponseEntity controller methods for serializing different amounts of detail for the same POJO (e.g. summary vs. detail page). This is also supported with View-based rendering by adding the serialization view type as a model attribute under a special key. See the section called “Jackson Serialization View Support” for details.
    JSONP is now supported with Jackson. See the section called “Jackson JSONP Support”.
    A new lifecycle option is available for intercepting @ResponseBody and ResponseEntity methods just after the controller method returns and before the response is written. To take advantage declare an @ControllerAdvice bean that implements ResponseBodyAdvice. The built-in support for @JsonView and JSONP take advantage of this. See Section 22.4.1, “Intercepting requests with a HandlerInterceptor”.

    There are three new HttpMessageConverter options:
        Gson — lighter footprint than Jackson; has already been in use in Spring Android.
        Google Protocol Buffers — efficient and effective as an inter-service communication data protocol within an enterprise but can also be exposed as JSON and XML for browsers.
        Jackson based XML serialization is now supported through the jackson-dataformat-xml extension. When using @EnableWebMvc or <mvc:annotation-driven/>, this is used by default instead of JAXB2 if jackson-dataformat-xml is in the classpath. 
    Views such as JSPs can now build links to controllers by referring to controller mappings by name. A default name is assigned to every @RequestMapping. For example FooController with method handleFoo is named "FC#handleFoo". The naming strategy is pluggable. It is also possible to name an @RequestMapping explicitly through its name attribute. A new mvcUrl function in the Spring JSP tag library makes this easy to use in JSP pages. See Section 22.7.2, “Building URIs to Controllers and methods from views”.
    ResponseEntity provides a builder-style API to guide controller methods towards the preparation of server-side responses, e.g. ResponseEntity.ok().
    RequestEntity is a new type that provides a builder-style API to guide client-side REST code towards the preparation of HTTP requests.

    MVC Java config and XML namespace:
        View resolvers can now be configured including support for content negotiation, see Section 22.16.8, “View Resolvers”.
        View controllers now have built-in support for redirects and for setting the response status. An application can use this to configure redirect URLs, render 404 responses with a view, send "no content" responses, etc. Some use cases are listed here.
        Path matching customizations are frequently used and now built-in. See Section 22.16.11, “Path Matching”. 
    Groovy markup template support (based on Groovy 2.3). See the GroovyMarkupConfigurer and respecitve ViewResolver and `View' implementations.
