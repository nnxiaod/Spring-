5.2 Data Access Improvements

    javax.transaction.Transactional is now supported via AspectJ.
    SimpleJdbcCallOperations now supports named binding.
    Full support for Hibernate ORM 5.0: as a JPA provider (automatically adapted) as well as through its native API (covered by the new org.springframework.orm.hibernate5 package).
    Embedded databases can now be automatically assigned unique names, and <jdbc:embedded-database> supports a new database-name attribute. See "Testing Improvements" below for further details.
