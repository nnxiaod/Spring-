4.1 JMS Improvements

Spring 4.1 introduces a much simpler infrastructure to register JMS listener endpoints by annotating bean methods with @JmsListener. The XML namespace has been enhanced to support this new style (jms:annotation-driven), and it is also possible to fully configure the infrastructure using Java config (@EnableJms, JmsListenerContainerFactory). It is also possible to register listener endpoints programmatically using JmsListenerConfigurer.

Spring 4.1 also aligns its JMS support to allow you to benefit from the spring-messaging abstraction introduced in 4.0, that is:

    Message listener endpoints can have a more flexible signature and benefit from standard messaging annotations such as @Payload, @Header, @Headers, and @SendTo. It is also possible to use a standard Message in lieu of javax.jms.Message as method argument.
    A new JmsMessageOperations interface is available and permits JmsTemplate like operations using the Message abstraction. 

Finally, Spring 4.1 provides additional miscellaneous improvements:

    Synchronous request-reply operations support in JmsTemplate
    Listener priority can be specified per <jms:listener/> element
    Recovery options for the message listener container are configurable using a BackOff implementation
    JMS 2.0 shared consumers are supported
