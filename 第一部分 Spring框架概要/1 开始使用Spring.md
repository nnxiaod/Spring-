### 1. 开始使用Spring

This reference guide provides detailed information about the Spring Framework. 

本参考指南提供Spring框架的详细信息。

It provides comprehensive documentation for all features, 
as well as some background about the underlying concepts 
(such as "Dependency Injection") that Spring has embraced.

包括Spring全部特性的综合文档，还包括Spring实现的一些基础概念的背景知识（比如“依赖注入”）。

If you are just getting started with Spring, 
you may want to begin using the Spring Framework by creating a Spring Boot based application. 

如果你刚刚开始接触Spring，你可以通过创建一个Spring Boot应用来使用Spring。

Spring Boot provides a quick (and opinionated) way to create a production-ready Spring based application. 

Spring Boot提供了一个快速（约定俗成的）途径去创建一个基于Spring的产品级应用，

It is based on the Spring Framework, 
favors convention over configuration, 
and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

它基于Spring框架，约定由于配置，让你尽可能快地运行起一个应用。

You can use start.spring.io to generate a basic project 
or follow one of the "Getting Started" guides like the Getting Started Building a RESTful Web Service one.
 
你可以从start.spring.io网站生成一个基本的项目，或者通过像《开始构建RESTful Web Service》这样的入门指南来开始。
 
As well as being easier to digest, 
these guides are very task focused, 
and most of them are based on Spring Boot. 

为了更容易理解，本指南目的性非常强，其中大部分示例基于Spring Boot。

They also cover other projects from the Spring portfolio that 
you might want to consider when solving a particular problem.

也会包含Spring体系的其他项目来解决某些特定问题。
