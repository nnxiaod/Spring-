#### 2.1 依赖注入和控制反转

A Java application — a loose term that runs the gamut from constrained, 
embedded applications to n-tier, 
server-side enterprise applications — typically 
consists of objects that collaborate to form the application proper. 
Thus the objects in an application have dependencies on each other.

一个n层的服务端的企业级Java应用，通常由相互合作的对象以适当的形式组成，这些对象相互合作制约。应用中的对象是相互依赖的。

Although the Java platform provides a wealth of application development functionality, 
it lacks the means to organize the basic building blocks into a coherent 
whole, leaving that task to architects and developers. 
Although you can use design patterns such as Factory, Abstract Factory, 
Builder, Decorator, and Service Locator to compose the various classes 
and object instances that make up an application, 
these patterns are simply that: best practices given a name, 
with a description of what the pattern does, where to apply it, 
the problems it addresses, and so forth. 
Patterns are formalized best practices that you must implement yourself 
in your application.

尽管Java平台提供了大量的应用开发功能，仍然缺少一种将基础的模块组成统一整体的方式，这个工作留给了架构师和开发者。
尽管有各种设计模式，如工厂模式、抽象工厂模式、建造者模式、装饰器模式和服务定位器模式等，可以用来将各种类和实例组成应用，
但是这些模式除了一个名字，只能告诉你怎么用、用在哪里和解决什么问题。这些模式是形式化的最佳实践，你必须在应用程序中自己实现。

The Spring Framework Inversion of Control (IoC) component addresses this concern by providing a formalized means of composing disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework codifies formalized design patterns as first-class objects that you can integrate into your own application(s). Numerous organizations and institutions use the Spring Framework in this manner to engineer robust, maintainable applications.
